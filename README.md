# Power BI Job Dashboard

## 📊 Project Overview
This is my **Power BI project** created as part of my learning journey.  
It follows the [Power BI for Data Analytics – Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwjaHCVNBWA) by Luke Barousse.  

The dashboard explores job data with:
- Country slicers to filter jobs
- Map visuals to show distribution
- KPIs for total jobs
- Interactive filtering
